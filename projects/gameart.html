                                Students taking this course learn to create high-quality 3D models and artwork for
                                games - and this artwork is used in current promotional material for the course.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>The course was previously advertised by showing off examples of high-quality work by more
                        advanced students.</p>
                    <p>User research showed that potential students generally only knew the basics of art before
                        joining the course.</p>
                    <p>Potential students were not sure if they had the skill to create the high-quality models shown
                        in promotional materials.</p>

                    <li>Promotional material that bridges the gap between what the reader knows and what they will
                        learn on the course.</li>
